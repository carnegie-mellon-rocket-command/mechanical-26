# Mechanical-26
ALL SUBTEAMS WELCOME! Everything and anything that's not hardware nor software for the 2026 CMRC cycle lives here. For access, contact **Sophia or Rahim** (eg the Avionics leads) on Discord. Please use IPS where possible to define things.

# Notation
## Folder names
Indexed with two numbers at the beginning, snakecase, in all caps. e.g. "00_USLI" or "01_NOSE+MAIN"

## File names
Files where multiple iterations may be relevant to hold on to, such as OpenRocket iterations, will always have a three-number index at the beginning, followed by a name, followed by the month and date it was last iterated upon. e.g. "004_Fullscale_9_09.ork".
Parts are a little bit more complex. If you downloaded a part from McMaster Carr or similar, please put the item's item number as its first name, e.g. "13735T59_US_Flag.sldprt" If you didn't download it from anywhere, please use snakecase with the first letter capitalized, e.g. "My_Awesome_Part.sldprt"
## Equations
Variable names should be in all caps, snake case, most-general to least-general. e.g. "AIRFRAME_OD" or "ATS_FORE_COUP_L". Last part of the name should have some sort of information about what the variable actually refers to, common ones include:
* D: Diameter
* L: Length
* N: Number, or quantity of things
* OD: Outer Diameter
* ID: Inner Diameter
* T: Thickness
* X: Displacement (relative to something)
