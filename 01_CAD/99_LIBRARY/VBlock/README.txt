Hello person assigned to print out more Vblocks, I am the ghost of Vblock past,
and you are probably a naive freshman like me, new to the ways of lasercutting.

Before we start, it seems that everything is in French for some reason. Probably
because of whoever made this sketch's language settings. Wacky.

Before you do anything, measure your stock (probably wood) with calipers.
Please do this. It takes 5 seconds and there's definitely a set of calipers 
either in the FabLab or RoboClub somewhere. If you don't follow the steps
below, your tabs will be the wrong size and everyone will laugh at you.

If there isn't a DXF for your stock thickness, MAKE A NEW ONE BY FOLLOWING
THE STEPS BELOW.

Enter this thickness value into "material_thickness" under the width.txt
file (it is in this folder somewhere). 

Then, open the VBlock assembly, and open each each part. 

Go to the equations menu (you can search this in the top bar somewhere) and 
make sure that the value for "material_thickness" has updated. If not,
uncheck then recheck the box linking the variable to the width.txt document.

Solidworks may tell you that you gave it an invalid file path. This is easy
to fix; just link it up properly.

Double check your assembly to make sure it's all fitting together.

Slam these parts onto a DXF (if you don't know how to, locate your Structures lead).
Make sure you print 2 VBlockEnd, 2 VBlockTop, 2VBlockSide, and 1 VBlockBase. 

Go to your favorite lasercutter and print that jawn out.

Assemble VBlock and enjoy!

I write all this out because whoever made the VBlocks before me had a skill
issue and forgot to adjust the "material_thickness" value, which lead to a messy
VBlock. This is all easily fixable if you follow the steps above and adjust the 
tabs as necessary before printing.

Also, save your new VBlock DXF in the DXF subfolder to quicken up the process for 
the poor souls in the future.
